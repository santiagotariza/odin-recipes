    <h1>GLaDOS's cake recipe</h1>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/half-life/images/a/a1/Cake.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100416151305&path-prefix=en" alt="The Cake">
    <h1>Description</h1>
    <h3>The Black Forest cake, alternatively referred to as the "Black Forest gateau," Or called "Fish shaped cracker cake" or simply "cake," typically consists of layers of chocolate, with whipped cream between layers, cherries on top, and sprinkled with white icing. However, some Black Forest cakes alternate with a covering of chocolate shavings, such as the type produced by Aperture Science. </h3>
    <h3>For a time in the Aperture Science computer-aided Enrichment Center, Black Forest cake was used as a motivational object for Test Subjects utilizing the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. After GLaDOS' takeover in May 200- however, she incinerates Test Subjects after the completion of tests, negating the need for the cake as a reward, but still uses it to motivate Test Subjects. </h3>
